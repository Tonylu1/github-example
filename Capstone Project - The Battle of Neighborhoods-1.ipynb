Assume people in New York city will stay home. Some of them will not cook a lot, they would like to ask food delivery.If we want to do uber delivery. we need to know which neighborhood has most of the Fast Food Restaurants. Then using foursquare to check comments on each \"Fast Food Restaurant\" to find out most popular restaurants in the neighborhood. So we can work around those restaurants to reduce any waiting time and to get maximium profit.  "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Data\nTo do this we need using following data\nData source: https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset and foursquare.com. In new_york_dataset data source, it includes Boroughs, Neighborhoods with their latitude and longitude. Using fousquare to get the latitude and longitude values of New York City, then filter the values with only fast food restaurants, and looking for rates for each fast food restaurants to find out high rate fast food restaurants in each neighborhoods. Lastly, python packages will be used to create maps and machine leanirng models to help make decision. \n\nMethodology \n* collect the new york city data from https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset\n* Using FourSquare API to find all venues for each neighborhood. \n* Filter out all venues that are fast food restaurants and checking the rating \n* Using Python visualization library to visualize the neighborhoods cluster and machine learning algorithm K-Mean custering to find the result.\n\nThe requried libraires will be used.
